# notabenoid-dockerfile

*More information [in Russian](README.ru.md).*

## Usage

### Building the image

    docker build -t notabenoid .

### Running the image (it will listen on 127.0.0.1:8080)

    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 --name notabenoid notabenoid

Or, alternatively, skip the building step and use the image uploaded to the Docker Hub (you also don't need to clone the notabenoid-dockerfile repository for this to work):

    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 --name notabenoid opennota/notabenoid

## Development

*Not up to date. Read the [russian version](README.ru.md).*

From this point on I'm assuming that you already have built an image named `notabenoid`.

On the host machine, clone the notabenoid repository and `cd` to it:

    git clone https://github.com/notabenoid/notabenoid.git
    cd notabenoid

Get the ID of the group `www-data` inside the container:

    docker run --rm --entrypoint grep notabenoid www-data /etc/group
    
    # Output:
    # www-data:x:33:

Create necessary directories and set permissions so that the web server running in the container could write to them:

    mkdir -p www/assets www/i/book www/i/upic www/i/tmp/upiccut protected/runtime
    chgrp -R 33 www/assets www/i/book www/i/upic www/i/tmp protected/runtime
    chmod -R g+w www/assets www/i/book www/i/upic www/i/tmp protected/runtime

Start the container using the current directory as a volume and replacing the existing `/srv/example.com` directory inside the container:

    docker run -v `pwd`:/srv/example.com -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 --name notabenoid notabenoid

Now you can edit the code outside of the container with your favorite editor.
